        <p>Born in 1959, in the mountians of Kirkuk, Kurdistan. Zana Zangana's placment on this earth was in a region known for it's rich history of our past in philosophy, educational, resources, and perhaps most notably religion. He was raised under the dark shadow of a opressive government known for genocide and ethnocide, that had claimed as a authoritive messager of God. This along with ohter grim events of injustice that had been erroneously declared rightous by the word of God, began a chain events within Zana to question the faith that was etched into his daily life.

          <p  class="animate__animated animate__fadeInBottomLeft animate__delay-4s">WHile his many years of hard work to build his buisness was a staple in his life, the passion of his search for the questions of his youth never wandered.
