      <h2 class="bk-pre-title">My Search for Truth:
        An Overview of the Contents of This Book</h2>
      <p>I needed to go back to the roots of Islam, back to the teachings of
        Judeo-Christianity (or, the “Ibrahimian religions” as I refer to the
        teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam throughout this book). I
        found this approach necessary for three reasons. First, Islam claims it
        fulfills the Judeo-Christian message. So, I needed to know what Islam
        was fulfilling. Second, identifying how Islam is rooted in the JudeoChristian teachings shows how all three
        religions are closely connected.
        And third, the history of all three religions are full of examples of
        morally questionable actions, such as killing, massacring, plundering,
        enslavement, and the violation of human dignity and innate rights—
        these despite breaking the Ten Commandments, given by God to
        Moses in Exodus 20:13–17, most particularly “Thou shalt not kill.”
        These actions are not just specific to Islam. Moreover, if atrocious
        actions are part of all Ibrahimian religious histories, then a moral
        thinker ought to question the authenticity of the entire message of all
        these religions. If God is all pure, all good, and all perfect, then the God
        described in these religions ought to be as well. If the Ten
        Commandments truly show what God determines to be good (as the
        Ibrahimian religions maintain), then the merit of the Ten
        Commandments should resonate throughout their scriptures and
        histories, and each religion should be nothing except the goodness it
        proclaims. </p>

      <p>To uncover God’s authentic message, I felt it necessary to examine
        the historical concept of God, and to provide an overview of the gradual development from polytheism (the
        concept of having many gods, which
        took on many shapes and forms) to monotheism (the concept of having
        a single, universal God). The first three chapters of this book are
        devoted to important early concepts God as conceived by three
        influential individuals: the great Ikhnaton, Zoroaster (or Zardesht, as
        his name is pronounced by those in his native area, and as he will be
        called throughout this book), and Moses. In the course of all my
        research for this book, I have come to the conclusion that a thorough
        examination of the ideas of Ikhnaton and Zardesht is crucial because
        the schools of thought that sprouted from these two individuals are
        responsible for most of the Ibrahimian literature. </p>

      <p> The rest of this book explores the Ibrahimian scriptures in order to
        bring to the surface the morally questionable actions attributed to God,
        and examines the historical context surrounding the times when these
        actions were recorded to attempt to understand whether each religion’s
        message is as authentic as it claims. In other words, during the times of
        morally reprehensible actions detailed in Islamic, Judeo, and Christian
        scripture, was the scriptural message revealed by God, or rather did
        these revelations spring from the historical, political, or social impulses
        of the time? </p>

      <p> (This book is my attempt to clarify these points. My hope is for an
        open-minded and thoughtful reader to start from a neutral position, see
        what is presented here, and assemble the conclusions for himself or
        herself. Consider God in the highest position, beyond and separate
        from the interpretation of any one of the Ibrahimian religions.
        Likewise, consider good and evil as moral questions higher than and
        separate from the interpretation of any one of the Ibrahimian
        religions.) </p>
